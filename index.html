      <p>Ever since I was introduced to this, almost magical, thing called view source, I've been fascinated with web development.
      I consider web development equal part logic and art. My passion for web development and programming, in general, is ever expanding.
      I love helping my clients tackle and solve problems that have real life implications. So, look no further and hire me to help you develop awesome things :)
